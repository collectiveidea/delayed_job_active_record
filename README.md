## Installation

Add the gem to your Gemfile:

    gem 'delayed_job_active_record'

Run `bundle install`.

If you're using Rails, run the generator to create the migration for the
delayed_job table.

    rails g delayed_job:active_record
    rake db:migrate

## Upgrading from 2.x to 3.0.0

If you're upgrading from Delayed Job 2.x, run the upgrade generator to create a
migration to add a column to your delayed_jobs table.

    rails g delayed_job:upgrade
    rake db:migrate

## Upgrading from base to trecker.com customizations

If you're upgrading Delayed Job base version, run the trecker generator to create a
migration to add the staff_id column to your delayed_jobs table. It is used
for prohibiting 2..n Delayed Job workers to pick jobs from the same staff.

    rails g delayed_job:trecker
    rake db:migrate

That's it. Use [delayed_job as normal](http://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job).
